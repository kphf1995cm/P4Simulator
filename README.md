## NS4 : A P4-driven Network Simulator

NS4 is a P4-driven network simulator and the first research effort on applying P4 to network simulation. For key features, follow [our paper poster](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/blob/master/ns4-poster.pdf) and [our paper](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4-DEV/blob/master/ns4-sosr.pdf).

We also provided beginners' guide to help you get started.

1. [NS4 Overview](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/NS4-Overview)
2. [Build and Install NS4](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/Build-and-Install-NS4)
3. [A Hands-on Example](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/A-Hands-on-Example)

NS4 is now being developed by NetArch Lab at Tsinghua University. NS4 is an open-source project under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/blob/master/License.md). We are longing for contributions. See [How to Contribute](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/wiki/How-to-contribute) for details.

*This project is still under development at this time and may not support all P4 programs.*
