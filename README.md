## P4Simulator : A P4-driven Network Simulator

P4Simulator is a P4-driven network simulator and the first research effort on applying P4 to network simulation. For key features, follow [our paper poster](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4/blob/master/ns4-poster.pdf) and [our paper](https://github.com/ns-4/NS4-DEV/blob/master/ns4-sosr.pdf).

We also provided beginners' guide to help you get started.
